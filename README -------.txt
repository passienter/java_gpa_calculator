Please use gpa.sql Includes courses and db (user) tables
I used XAMPP to host my local server with default port 3306.
To make it run I turned on 'Apache' and 'MySQL' modules once installed.
In http://localhost/phpmyadmin please import the gpa.sql file.

The test username is 'admin' that includes 3 pre-entered courses.
